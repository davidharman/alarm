# alarm
Alarm in Bash with the use of termdown (https://github.com/trehn/termdown).

I wanted:
- a simple alarm which I set in Bash
- to provide just an hour and minute
- a countdown to show how long left
- start and stop times to be shown if CTRL+C is shown 


First install TermDown
<i>pip install termdown</i>

Then place the alarm script from this repo in to your bin folder

Now run Alarm

alarm 10:00 Meeting starwars

You will now get a timer for the remaining minutes showing the word meeting in the starwars font from now until 10:00 and at the end a beep will sound.


Please Note: Modify the timer script if you want to change the sound.
